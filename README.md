# Bitwise-Operators
AIM:
To understand and implement Bitwise Operators in C++.

OBJECTIVE:
Understand the concept and working of bitwise operators.

Learn how to apply them to perform bit-level operations in C++.

Practice writing C++ programs using bitwise operators for tasks such as bit manipulation, masking, and shifting.

TOOLS REQUIRED:
C++ Compiler (GCC, Turbo C++, etc.)

Text Editor or IDE (Code::Blocks, VS Code, Dev C++, etc.)

THEORY:
Bitwise operators operate directly on the binary representation of integers. They are primarily used for low-level programming, such as in device drivers, embedded systems, and performance-critical code.

Types of Bitwise Operators in C++:
Operator	Description	Example (a = 5, b = 3)	Binary Result
&	Bitwise AND	a & b = 1	0101 & 0011 = 0001
`	`	Bitwise OR	`a
^	Bitwise XOR	a ^ b = 6	0101 ^ 0011 = 0110
~	Bitwise NOT (One's complement)	~a = -6	~0101 = 1010 (in 2's complement)
<<	Left Shift	a << 1 = 10	0101 << 1 = 1010
>>	Right Shift	a >> 1 = 2	0101 >> 1 = 0010
